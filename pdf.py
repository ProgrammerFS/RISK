All banks licensed by the Central Bank of the UAE must ensure that Pillar 1 risks - credit, market, and operational risk - are mitigated by capital.\n2. Each bank is required to have a process to assess its overall capital adequacy as a function of its risk profile and its strategy.\n3. As part of the Supervisory Review and Evaluation Process (SREP), the Central Bank analyses the capitalisation levels of banks among other information, referring to the results of the ICAAP with regard to the internal view of capital adequacy.\n4. Each bank bears the responsibility for the appropriate identification, estimation, and reporting of risks, and the corresponding the calibration of capital necessary to mitigate these risks.\n5. This Guidance presents minimum expected practices to be considered by each bank in order to undertake their ICAAP, covering the process, content, outcome, and usage.\n6. It also intends to support each bank in the identification, measurement, reporting, and mitigation of Pillar 2 risks.\n7. All methodologies employed by a bank for its ICAAP should be relevant to its business model, risk profile, to the geographies of its exposures, and, in particular, to the features of the UAE economy.\n8. The Central Bank may apply proportionality for smaller and less complex banks when evaluating the ICAAP.\n9. For the licensed operations of foreign banks in the UAE, when this document refers to the banks Board, it should be comprehended as the Managing Director and/ or the highest committee in the UAE operations of the bank in which the Managing Director has to be the Chairman.\n10. This Guidance serves several purposes. It (i) Explains in more detail the Central Banks expectations on fulfilling the requirements of the ICAAP Capital Standards, in particular, related to the ICAAP (process) at each bank and certain aspects of the content of the ICAAP report; (ii) Covers expectations on some processual elements of the ICAAP, such as an appropriate approval process of the ICAAP report and its submission timelines; and (iii) Formulates expectations about additional sections of the ICAAP report (e.g. related to internal audit findings and changes compared to the previous ICAAP report).'], 'Introduction and Scope': ['1. This Standard discusses the key principles of supervisory review, with respect to banking risks, including guidance relating to, among other things, the treatment of interest rate risk in the banking book, credit risk (stress testing, residual risk, and credit concentration risk), operational risk, enhanced cross-border communication and cooperation, and securitisation.\n2. Banks are only permitted to perform a Pillar I Plus approach. Internal models are not allowed in ICAAP for estimating capital requirements for credit, market or operational risk. For risk management purposes, banks may use internal models, but figures reported to the Central Bank should be based on the Standardised Approach.\n3. All buffers are to be in addition to existing requirements. An off-setting of certain requirements is not permitted i.e. lower Pillar 2 for Pillar 1 risks are not allowed.\n4. The type of capital which the Central Bank will require banks to provide  for pillar 2 risks will be solely at the discretion of the Central Bank; this may be CET1 only, or a mix between CET1 , AT1 and Tier 2.\n5. It should be noted that given a normal business model the capital risk charge for Pillar 2 should always be positive if the risk exists (in particular for the IRRBB and Concentration risk).']}, {'ICAAP Executive Summary': ['The main findings of the ICAAP\nA brief description of the ICAAP governance framework covering the stakeholders, the assessment process, the challenging process and the approval process\nA brief presentation of the banks structure, subsidiaries, businesses, material risks, risk appetite, and risk mitigating actions, where applicable\nA description of the current capital position of the bank showing the allocation of capital per risk type, covering Pillar 1 and Pillar 2 risks\nEach bank should complete the ICAAP Executive Summary Table (Table 3) as indicated in Appendix 2 of this document\nA description of the current capital composition of the bank against minimum capital requirements covering at least CET1, AT1, and Tier 2 capital ratios\nA forward-looking analysis of the budgeted capital position of the bank, based on the banks expected business plan over the next three (3) years, reflecting the current, and expected economic conditions.

It supplements the Pillar 1 minimum regulatory capital requirements by identifying risks that are not addressed or not fully addressed through Pillar 1 regulations, referred to as Pillar 2 risks, and determining a level of capital commensurate with the level of risk.\n- The frequency of reporting to the Board is expected to be at least quarterly, but, depending on the size, complexity, business model, risk types of the institution, and the market environment, reporting might need to be more frequent to ensure timely management actions.\n- The ICAAP should be supported by robust methodologies and data. All models used directly or indirectly in the ICAAP should follow the banks model management framework, in compliance with the Central Bank Standards and Guidance.\n- The ICAAP of local banks is expected to assess capital adequacy for the bank on a stand-alone basis, at regulatory consolidated level, and for the entities of the group. The ICAAP should primarily evaluate the capital requirement and capital adequacy of the bank at group level, following the regulatory consolidation. However, each bank should analyse whether additional risks arise from the group structure of the bank.\n- The ICAAP and the banks business strategy form a feedback process. While the ICAAP has to reflect the banks business strategy, and business decisions. The bank should implement a formal process to analyse whether the outcomes of the ICAAP influence the business strategy.\n- The ICAAP should have an interactive relationship with other key processes within the bank, including but not limited to, (i) business strategies, (ii) financial budgeting, (iii) risk management, (iv) risk appetite setting, and (v) stress tests.\n- Each bank should demonstrate its appropriate usage of the ICAAP via the production of thorough documentation, reporting covering the process, methodology, decision-making for capital allocation, and strategy.\n- The Central Bank shall evaluate evidence that the bank has embraced the process for business rather than regulatory reasons. Evidence should be provided that the management has, through the ICAAP, made the business more efficient or less risky.'], 'Four key principles of supervisory review': ['* Principle 1: Banks must have a process for assessing their overall capital adequacy in relation to their risk profile and a strategy for maintaining their capital levels.\n* Principle 2: The Central Bank will review and evaluate banks internal capital adequacy assessments and strategies, as well as their ability to monitor and ensure their compliance with regulatory capital ratios. The Central Bank will take appropriate supervisory action if it is not satisfied with the result of this process.\n* Principle 3: The Central Bank expects banks to operate above the minimum regulatory capital ratios and may require banks to hold capital in excess of the minimum.\n* Principle 4: The Central Bank will intervene at an early stage to prevent capital from falling below the minimum levels required to support the risk characteristics of a particular bank and will require rapid remedial action if capital is not maintained or restored.']}, {'Capital Planning': ['The major/critical/important points in this section are:\n\n1. Banks should operate above the minimum capital requirements set by the Central Bank.\n2. Each bank should have a capital plan approved by the Board.\n3. The objective of capital planning is to ensure that:\n    - Each bank is compliant with minimum regulatory requirements\n    - The bank is viable and able to endure external economic changes\n    - Each banks capital is calibrated to its risk profile in order to absorb unexpected losses through time, including periods of economic downturn.\n4. The ICAAP should be designed as a tool to adequately support these objectives.\n5. The ICAAP should be forward-looking taking into account both internal and external drivers over a period covering three (3) to five (5) years.\n6. The multi-year capital forecast should be assessed and calibrated through two perspectives:\n    - Pillar 1: The banks ability to fulfil all of its capital-related regulatory, supervisory requirements, and demands\n    - Pillar 2: The banks ability to cope with capital demands beyond that of the regulatory requirements, in accordance to its risk profile.\n7. If the bank identifies a shortfall in capital pertaining to either Pillar 1 or Pillar 2. It is expected to consider measures to maintain adequate capitalisation, reverse the trend, review its strategy, and risk appetite.\n8. For each internal stress test scenario for capital planning purposes, each bank is expected to consider credible, quantifiable management actions that the bank could practically take to mitigate any capital impact of stress scenarios.\n9. The capital planning should not be limited to risk-based capital ratios but should also consider the leverage ratio of the bank.\n10. Bank should analyse and consider unaccounted foreseeable events in the capital plan, e.g. regulatory changes like the revised standardised approaches for credit, market and operational risk.'], 'Specific issues to be addressed under the supervisory': ['* Specific issues to be addressed under the supervisory framework\n    * The need for effective supervision of financial institutions\n    * The need for cooperation and coordination between supervisors\n    * The need for transparency and accountability in the supervisory process\n    * The need for adequate resources for supervision']}, {'Material Risks': ['* Business model analysis (BMA) and strategic risk\n* Credit risk\n* Market risk\n* Operational risk\n* Credit concentration risk\n* Interest Rate Risk in the Banking Book (IRRBB)\n* Model Risk\n* Financial Risks from Climate Change\n* Liquidity Risk and Funding Cost'], 'review process': [None]}, {'ICAAP Stress Test and Reverse Stress Test': ['The following are the major/critical/important points in the ICAAP Stress Test and Reverse Stress Test section:\n\n- Stress tests should be conducted regularly and should be forward-looking.\n- The scenarios used for stress tests should be designed to capture the risks and potential losses appropriately.\n- Stress tests should be supported by robust methodologies.\n- Stress tests should be used to support decision-making throughout the bank.\n- Reverse stress tests should be conducted to identify the sources of potential failure and to inform Senior Management of vulnerabilities.'], 'Other aspects of the supervisory review process': ['* Supervisory transparency and accountability\n* Significance of risk transfer\n* Market innovations\n* Risk evaluation and management\n* Provision of implicit support\n* Residual risks\n* Call provisions\n* Early amortisation']}, {'ICAAP Submission and Approval': ['The annual ICAAP report should be submitted to the Central Bank on or before the submission dates addressed in Table 1.\nAll documents have to be submitted to the respective Central Bank reviewer by softcopy (submitted in word or pdf format), sending a copy to bsed.basel@cbuae.gov.ae.\nThe submission dates below as per Notice 2940/2022 differentiate between (i) national banks and foreign bank and (ii) size and importance of the banks: (Table 1)\nThe ICAAP report should be approved by: (i) Senior Management (including the CRO): The bank should use Appendix 1 – ICAAP – Mandatory disclosure form (Table 2) and include it as an attachment to the ICAAP report; (ii) Board approval: For all local banks, the ICAAP document must be approved by the Board or Board risk committee, and Senior Management prior to submission to the Central Bank.

', 'Operational risk is the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes, ', 'people, or systems, or external events.

Therefore, banks should ensure ', 'that their Pillar 2 capital charge covers operational risks that are not captured by regulatory ', 'capital methodologies. The analysis should include a robust and conservative forecast of ', 'operational risk losses and respective capital requirements (at least split into conduct and non-', 'conduct risks). ', '75. ', 'Legal risk is considered an operational risk. Each bank is required to analyse, assess, ', 'and quantify the impact of legal risk failures on its capital structure.

The ', 'outcome of legal and/or regulatory issues to which the bank is currently exposed, and others, ', 'which may arise in the future, is difficult to predict and, consequently, there can be no ', 'assurance that the outcome of a legal matters will not be material to the financial condition of ', 'the bank. ', '76. ', 'Given the potential impact from operational risk, each bank should evaluate under ', 'Pillar 2 risks arising from business conduct risks and money laundering / financing of terrorism. ', 'In addition, each bank should consider internal and external operational risks faced by it, ', 'including but not limited to operational cyber risk, IT risks, and outsourcing, and each bank is ', 'expected to consider ways in which it can improve its operational resilience. Each bank should ', 'provide details in the ICAAP report on the outcome of its Risk Control Self-Assessment (RCSA) ', 'process to collate bottom-up operational risk drivers across businesses. ', '77. ', 'Each bank should undertake quantitative stress testing based on its historical loss data ', 'and operational risk profile. ', 'E. ', 'Credit Concentration Risk', ' ', '78. ', 'Section V.D of the ICAAP Standard requires banks to address weaknesses at the ', ' ', '162 ', ' ', 'CBUAE Classification: Public ', 'portfolio level including credit concentrations risk. Credit concentration risk is the incremental ', 'credit loss in a portfolio of credit exposures, caused by high correlation between the credit risk ', 'drivers of those exposures. Such concentration risk arises mostly due to high correlations and ', 'dependencies between individual obligors (name concentration) or between economic sectors ', '(sectoral concentration). Credit concentration risk can affect a bank’s health or core operations, ', 'liquidity, earnings and capital ratios. The Central Bank considers concentration risk as a key ', 'material Pillar 2 risk for all UAE banks. ', '79. ', 'Consequently, credit concentration arises when large exposures are associated with a ', 'small number of obligors or a small number of sectors, but not only. Credit concentration risk ', 'can arise from a seemingly granular portfolio but with high correlation between the obligors’ ', 'risk drivers. ', '80. ', 'In accordance with the Central Bank re Large Exposures - Credit Concentrations Limits ', '(Notice No.226/2018), an exposure is deemed large if it accounts for more than 10% of a ', 'bank’s capital. Such threshold has been implemented for regulatory purposes. The ', 'measurement of concentration risk for risk management purposes and for determining Pillar 2 ', 'risk capital requirements should refer to the wider definition of concentration risk. Each bank ', 'is exposed to a degree of concentration risk, even when complying with the Large Exposure ', 'Regulation. ', '81. ', 'Each bank should perform a detailed risk analysis specific to the Real Estate exposures ', '(RE) of the bank and the Central Bank re Standards for Real Estate Exposures (Notice No. ', '5733/2021). ', '82. ', 'Credit concentration risk is a common feature of UAE banks, but currently the Central ', 'Bank regulations for banks do not include an explicit Pillar 1 capital requirement for name and ', 'sector concentration risk. Credit concentration risk is a key prudential risk for which the capital ', 'requirement is at the discretion of banks, and it should be held under Pillar 2. This risk should ', 'warrant particular attention from each bank. In particular:  ', '(i) ', 'For the purpose of risk management, each bank should ensure that credit ', 'concentration risk is pro-actively and efficiently addressed. Each bank should ', 'develop policies and procedures for the identification, measurement, monitoring, ', 'and reporting of credit concentration risk. Credit concentration risk arises from ', 'exposures to obligors structured as conglomerates. Therefore each bank should ', 'have a mechanism in place to identify and aggregate exposures across related ', 'entities based on their legal relationships. Data should be aggregated across ', 'systems operated by different business units or entities. This should be indicated ', 'through the bank’s management information system (MIS); ', '(ii) ', 'For the purpose of estimating the Pillar 2 capital associated with credit ', 'concentration risk, each bank should build upon the methodologies employed ', 'for risk management. These methods should be developed further, as deemed ', 'appropriate, in order to fully measure the additional capital. Each bank should ', 'compare several methodologies and propose a choice based on clear and ', 'documented justification. At a minimum, each bank should calculate and report ', 'the additional capital using the Herfindahl-Hirschman Index (HHI) methodology; ', 'and ', '(iii) ', 'For the purpose of capital planning, each bank should ensure that concentration ', 'risk is taken into account adequately within its ICAAP. Each bank should assess ', 'the amount of capital, which it consider adequate to hold given the level of ', 'concentration risk in their portfolios and given their business plan and the ', 'expected economic environment. ', ' ', '163 ', ' ', 'CBUAE Classification: Public ', 'F. ', 'Interest Rate Risk in the Banking Book (IRRBB)', ' ', '83. ', 'IRRBB is the risk of loss in the banking book caused by changes in interest rates. ', 'Interest rate risk can arise both in the banking book and/or the trading book. While interest rate ', 'risk in the trading book is addressed under the Pillar 1 market risk framework, the interest rate ', 'risk in the banking book should be addressed under Pillar 2. Conventional banks refer to this ', 'risk as IRRBB while Islamic banks are exposed to the analogous risk called profit rate risk in ', 'the banking book (PRRBB). ', '84. ', 'Each bank should define a risk appetite pertaining to IRRRB that should be approved ', 'by the Board and implemented through a comprehensive risk appetite framework, i.e. policies ', 'and procedures for limiting and controlling IRRBB. Each bank should have a process ', 'supported by adequate policies to manage IRRBB appropriately. This involves, as for any other ', 'risk, comprehensive identification, measurement, reporting, monitoring, and mitigation. ', '85. ', 'The measurement process should be based upon several existing Standards and ', 'Guidance:  ', '(i) ', 'Central Bank “Standards re Capital Adequacy of Banks in the UAE - ICAAP ', 'Standards”; ', '(ii) ', 'Central Bank “Regulation and Standards re Interest Rate & Rate of Return Risk ', 'in the Banking Book” in 2018 (Notice 3021/2018 and Circular 165/2018); ', '(iii) ', 'Central Bank Model Management Standards and Guidance in 2022 (Notice ', '5052/2022); and ', '(iv) ', 'Basel Framework - Interest Rate Risk in the Banking Book (SRP 31). ', 'Measurement ', '86. ', 'The assessment should include all positions of each bank’s potential basis risk, re-', 'pricing gaps, commercial margins, gaps for material currencies optionality, and non-maturing ', 'deposits. The quantitative impact analysis should be supported by description and analysis of ', 'the key assumptions made by the bank, in particular, assumptions regarding loan ', 'prepayments, the behaviour of non-maturity deposits (CASA), non-rated sensitive assets, ', 'contractual interest rate ceilings or floors for adjustable-rate items, and measuring the ', 'frequency of the interest rate risk in the banking book. ', '87. ', 'DSIBs and other banks with significant interest rate risk (IRR) exposure should ', 'compute the economic value of equity (EVE) at a granular facility level, while non-DSIBs may ', 'compute EVE at exposure level, which is based upon the summation of discounted gap risk ', 'across time buckets, rather than a granular net present value (NPV) estimation at exposure ', 'level. ', 'Scenarios ', '88. ', 'For the purpose of capital calibration, each bank should employ the interest rate shock ', 'scenarios corresponding to Table 12 of Central Bank Model Management Guidance and table ', '2 of the SRP 31 for their AED and non-AED positions respectively. ', '89. ', 'In addition to the standard shocks prescribed above, DSIBs and other banks with ', 'significant exposure to interest rate risk are expected to apply further shocks/ idiosyncratic ', 'scenarios, which will take into account: ', '\uf0b7', ' ', 'The bank’s inherent risk profile; ', ' ', '164 ', ' ', 'CBUAE Classification: Public ', '\uf0b7', ' ', 'Historical shocks experienced by the bank due to market sentiment and ', 'corresponding to macro-financial factors; and ', '\uf0b7', ' ', 'Additional scenarios prescribed by the Central Bank specifically through ', 'supervisory interactions or financial stability processes. ', 'Capital Calculation ', '90. ', 'The capital requirement should be aggregated across all currencies and scenarios ', 'conservatively. ', '91. ', 'The estimation of the Pillar 2 capital corresponding to IRRBB should be based on the ', 'most conservative loss arising from (i) the change in the economic value of equity (ΔEVE), and ', '(ii) the change in net interest income (ΔNII). The most conservative result should be considered ', 'across all the scenarios calibrated by the bank. (In avoidance of doubt, the allocated capital ', 'for IRRBB should not be lower than the maximum of the absolute EVE impact and the absolute ', 'NII impact: Max(abs(EVE impact), abs(NII impact). ', '92. ', 'The Central Bank considers a bank as an outlier when the IRRBB EVE impact based ', 'on the standard parallel shock leads to an economic value decline of more than 15% of its Tier ', '1 capital. The Central Bank may request an outlier bank to: ', '(i) ', 'Reduce its IRRBB exposures (e.g. by hedging); ', '(ii) ', 'Raise additional capital; ', '(iii) ', 'Set constraints on the internal risk parameters used by a bank; and/ or ', '(iv) ', 'Improve its risk management framework. ', '93. ', 'Irrespective of the approach or model chosen by the bank, at a minimum each bank ', 'should calculate and report IRRBB using the methodology described by the Central Bank ', 'Model Management Standards and Guidance. ', 'G. ', 'Model Risk', ' ', '94. ', 'Models have become an integral part of decision-making in the banking sector for risk ', 'management, business decisions, and accounting. Inaccurate model results, e.g. based on ', 'wrong assumptions or valuations, may lead to actual or potential financial losses or an ', 'underestimation of risks. Therefore, the Central Bank considers model risk a significant risk ', 'type. ', '95. ', 'Simple models should not be confused with poorly designed models.  Poorly designed ', 'models can be misleading and interfere with sound decision-making. Small and/or ', 'unsophisticated banks can employ simple models. However, they cannot employ poorly ', 'designed models. Each bank should manage model risk in accordance to the Central Bank ', 'Model Management Standards and Guidance. ', '96. ', 'Model risk should be incorporated in each banks’ risk framework alongside other key ', 'risks, as inherent consequences of conducting their activities (refer to Appendix 3.2). ', 'Consequently, model risk should be managed through a formal process incorporating the ', 'bank’s appetite for model uncertainty. The framework should be designed to identify, measure, ', 'monitor, and mitigate this risk. A bank should mitigate a large appetite for model risk by ', 'counter-measures such as conservative buffers on model results and/ or additional allocated ', 'Pillar 2 capital. ', ' ', '165 ', ' ', 'CBUAE Classification: Public ', '97. ', 'The Central Bank recognises that the estimation of model risk is challenging. However, ', 'each bank should demonstrate that they have implemented steps to measure the potential ', 'losses arising from model risk. At minimum, each bank should implement a grouping approach ', 'to categorise models according to their associated model risk. The uncertainty and losses ', 'arising from models should be estimated by using a range of different techniques, including:  ', '(i) ', 'Internal and external validations;  ', '(ii) ', 'Comparison against alternative models; ', '(iii) ', 'Sensitivity analysis; and  ', '(iv) ', 'Stress tests. ', '98. ', 'Each bank should also consider the quality of its model risk management in the model ', 'risk analysis, including but not limited to the quality of model documentation, data, ', 'assumptions, validation, staff, implementation, and usage. ', 'Risk Diversification Effects ', '99. ', 'Each bank is expected to take a prudent approach whenever assuming risk ', 'diversification effects.  Furthermore, each bank should be aware that the Central Bank as a ', 'matter of principle will not take into account inter-risk diversification in the SREP.

', 'Banks are expected to build up Board awareness and understanding of the financial ', 'risks arising from climate change and how they will affect their business models. Each bank ', 'should use scenario analysis and stress tests to improve the risk identification process, to ', 'understand the short- and long-term financial risks to their business model from climate ', 'change, and to develop appropriate strategies accordingly. ', 'I. ', 'Liquidity Risk and Funding Cost', ' ', '101. ', 'Though capital is not a direct mitigation for liquidity risk and liquidity is not a mitigation ', 'for capital risk, both risk types are interlinked. The Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment ', 'Process (ICAAP) and the Internal Liquidity Adequacy Assessment Process (ILAAP) are ', 'expected to inform each other; with respect to the underlying assumptions, stress test results, ', 'and forecasted management actions.

', '102. ', 'For example, each bank is expected to assess the impact of deteriorating capital levels, ', 'as projected in the ICAAP, on their liquidity.
