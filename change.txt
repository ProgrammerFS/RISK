Introduction and Purpose
The following are the important points in this section that will help the risk team:
1. Each bank is required to have a process to assess its overall capital adequacy as a function of its risk profile and its strategy.
2. Each bank is required to maintain appropriate capital levels in accordance with the Central Bank Standards on Pillar 2 capital. This process is termed the Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process (ICAAP).
3. The ICAAP is a critical reference for supervision and for the supervisory dialogue between banks and Central Bank.
4. All methodologies employed by a bank for its ICAAP should be relevant to its business model, risk profile, to the geographies of its exposures, and, in particular, to the features of the UAE economy.
5. The Central Bank may apply proportionality for smaller and less complex banks when evaluating the ICAAP. This does not mean that smaller or less complex banks are exempted from the reporting requirements or from undertaking a comprehensive assessment of the risks they face.
6. For the licensed operations of foreign banks in the UAE, when this document refers to the bank’s Board, it should be comprehended as the Managing Director and/ or the highest committee in the UAE operations of the bank in which the Managing Director has to be the Chairman.
7. The ICAAP report should include an appropriate approval process and submission timelines.
8. The ICAAP report should include sections related to internal audit findings and changes compared to the previous ICAAP report.

The following are the risks mentioned in this section:
1. The risk that banks may not have a comprehensive and proportionate ICAAP process in place.
2. The risk that banks may not use appropriate methodologies to assess their Pillar 2 risks.
3. The risk that banks may not be able to justify their decisions and modelling choices with historical data and benchmarking.
4. The risk that banks may not be able to comply with the Central Bank Model Management Standards and Guidance.
5. The risk that banks may not be able to maintain appropriate capital levels in accordance with the Central Bank Standards on Pillar 2 capital.

ICAAP Executive Summary
The executive summary of the ICAAP document should explain the views of Senior Management and the Board on the suitability of the bank’s capital to cover the risks faced by the bank.
The executive summary should contain the following elements:
- The main findings of the ICAAP
- A brief description of the ICAAP governance framework
- A brief presentation of the bank’s structure, subsidiaries, businesses, material risks, risk appetite, and risk mitigating actions, where applicable
- A description of the current capital position of the bank showing the allocation of capital per risk type, covering Pillar 1 and Pillar 2 risks
- A description of the current capital composition of the bank against minimum capital requirements covering at least CET1, AT1, and Tier 2 capital ratios
- A forward-looking analysis of the budgeted capital position of the bank, based on the bank’s expected business plan over the next three (3) years, reflecting the current, and expected economic conditions. This needs to cover expected dividend distribution
- An analysis of the capital position and capital ratios under several stress scenarios, the analysis of the stress scenarios should include the intended risk mitigation actions
- An assessment of the adequacy of the bank’s risk management processes including critical judgment on the areas that need improvement
- A conclusion of the ICAAP addressing the suitability of the capital to cover the bank’s current and expected risks.

ICAAP Governance
**Key points for the risk team:**

* The Board of Directors is required to approve the ICAAP.
* The Board has ultimate ownership and responsibility of the ICAAP.
* The ICAAP governance framework should ensure that the ICAAP is an integral part of the bank’s management process and decision-making.
* The policy framework should be approved by the Board and Senior Management has to implement the framework via effective procedures and systems.
* The risk framework has to be applied across the organisation.

**Risks:**

* The ICAAP may not be effective if it is not subject to an effective decision-making process.
* The ICAAP may not be implemented effectively if the Board and Senior Management do not have a clear understanding of their responsibilities.
* The ICAAP may not be applied consistently across the organisation.

ICAAP Methodology, Scope and Use Test
**Key points**

* The ICAAP is an ongoing process that should be conducted at least quarterly.
* The ICAAP should be supported by robust methodologies and data.
* The ICAAP should be consistent across entities within a group.
* The ICAAP should be used to inform business decisions and risk management processes.
* The ICAAP should be documented and regularly reported on.
* The Central Bank will evaluate evidence that the bank has embraced the ICAAP process for business reasons.

**Risks**

* The ICAAP may not be effective if it is not supported by robust methodologies and data.
* The ICAAP may not be consistent across entities within a group, which could lead to material misstatements in the capital adequacy assessment.
* The ICAAP may not be used to inform business decisions and risk management processes, which could lead to the bank taking on too much risk.
* The ICAAP may not be documented or regularly reported on, which could make it difficult for the bank to demonstrate its compliance with regulatory requirements.
* The Central Bank may not be satisfied with the evidence that the bank has embraced the ICAAP process for business reasons, which could lead to the bank being subject to additional regulatory scrutiny.

Capital Planning
The important points in this section are:
1. Banks should operate above the minimum capital requirements set by the Central Bank.
2. The ICAAP should be designed as a tool to adequately support these objectives.
3. The ICAAP should be forward-looking taking into account both internal and external drivers over a period covering three (3) to five (5) years.
4. The multi-year capital forecast should be assessed and calibrated through two perspectives:
    * Pillar 1: The bank’s ability to fulfil all of its capital-related regulatory, supervisory requirements, and demands;
    * Pillar 2: The bank’s ability to cope with capital demands beyond that of the regulatory requirements, in accordance to its risk profile.
5. If the bank identifies a shortfall in capital pertaining to either Pillar 1 or Pillar 2. It is expected to consider measures to maintain adequate capitalisation, reverse the trend, review its strategy, and risk appetite.
6. The following elements should be included in the ICAAP report or related appendix:
    * Assumptions related to business developments over the forecasted period;
    * Assumptions related to the economic environment over the forecasted period;
    * Summary of historic capital base, aggregate RWAs, and CAR ratios for a minimum of five (5) years;
    * Disclosure of the following forecasted financial projections:
        * Detailed balance sheet;
        * Detailed statement of profit and loss;
        * Break down of Capital base into its regulatory components;
        * Break down of Risk Weighted Assets (RWAs) components;
        * Significant ratios (e.g. CET 1, Tier 1, and CAR);
        * A method to calibrate capital needs to the current and expected levels of risks, in coherence with the bank’s risk appetite, business plan, and strategy;
        * It should include the likely future constraints on the availability and the use of capital;
        * Any future regulatory and accounting changes that can potentially impact such plan.
7. Banks are required to fulfill internal risk appetite requirements in the bank’s self-assessment of Pillar 1 and Pillar 2 minimum regulatory capital requirements. Banks should fulfill the minimum capital requirements plus capital buffer requirements under business as usual (BAU) conditions. Under stress testing (ST) banks should fulfill the minimum capital requirements without the requirement to meet buffer requirements.
8. The capital planning should not be limited to risk-based capital ratios but should also consider the leverage ratio of the bank. Bank should analyse and consider unaccounted foreseeable events in the capital plan, e.g. regulatory changes like the revised standardised approaches for credit, market and operational risk.

The risks include:
1. The bank may not be able to maintain adequate capitalisation, reverse the trend, review its strategy, and risk appetite.
2. The bank may not be able to fulfill the minimum capital requirements plus capital buffer requirements under business as usual (BAU) conditions.
3. The bank may not be able to fulfill the minimum capital requirements without the requirement to meet buffer requirements under stress testing (ST) conditions.
4. The bank may not be able to consider unaccounted foreseeable events in the capital plan, e.g. regulatory changes like the revised standardised approaches for credit, market and operational risk.

ICAAP Stress Test and Reverse Stress Test
Here are the important points in this section:
- Stress tests help banks to identify vulnerabilities and potential losses under exceptional events.
- Stress tests should be integrated, regular, rigorous, and forward-looking.
- The frequency of stress tests should depend on their type, scope, depth, and on the wider economic context.
- Stress test scenarios should be designed to capture the risks and potential losses appropriately.
- Stress test results should be used to support decision-making throughout the bank effectively.
- Reverse stress tests should be conducted at least once a year.

ICAAP Submission and Approval
The important points in this section are:
1. The annual ICAAP report should be submitted to the Central Bank on or before the submission dates addressed in Table 1.
2. All documents have to be submitted to the respective Central Bank reviewer by softcopy (submitted in word or pdf format), sending a copy to bsed.basel@cbuae.gov.ae.
3. The ICAAP report should be approved by:
    - Senior Management (including the CRO): The bank should use Appendix 1 – ICAAP – Mandatory disclosure form (Table 2) and include it as an attachment to the ICAAP report;
    - Board approval: For all local banks, the ICAAP document must be approved by the Board or Board risk committee, and Senior Management prior to submission to the Central Bank. The meeting minutes of the Board of Directors meeting should state the approval of the ICAAP document and challenges that have taken place;
    - For foreign branches, the ICAAP document should be approved by (a) the managing director and/ or relevant highest committee of the bank in the UAE, and by (b) their head office, stating that the ICAAP assumptions and forecasts are in line with the group’s assumptions, forecasts, and that the group’s Board approves/ endorse the results of the ICAAP.

The risks associated with this section are:
1. The ICAAP report may not be submitted on time, which could result in fines or other penalties from the Central Bank.
2. The ICAAP report may not be approved by Senior Management or the Board, which could also result in fines or other penalties from the Central Bank.
3. The ICAAP report may not be accurate or complete, which could lead to the bank taking on too much risk or not being prepared for a financial crisis.

Internal Control Review
The following are important points in this section which will help the risk team:

- Internal control functions should perform regular reviews of the risk management process to make sure its coherence, validity, and rationality.
- The review of the ICAAP should cover the following:
    - Ensuring that the ICAAP is complete and suitable as of the bank’s context, operational conditions, the reliability of controls behind it;
    - The process of identifying all material risks;
    - Efficiency of the information systems that support the ICAAP;
    - Ensuring that the measurement methodologies in use are suitable to support the ICAAP valuation;
    - Ensuring the accuracy, and comprehensive of the data input to the ICAAP;
    - Rational behind the ICAAP output and assumptions in use;
    - Rational and suitability of stress tests and analysis of assumptions;
    - Consolidation of the ICAAP outcomes with the risk management (e.g., limit setting and monitoring); and
    - Rational of the capital plan and internal capital targets.
- In addition, the review should cover the integrity and validity of regulatory data submitted to the Central Bank during the course of the year relating to Pillar 1 capital requirements.
- The role and validity of internal control functions are also important and should be verified with regard to other topics. For example:
    - All risk quantification methodologies and models must be subject to independent validation (internal/ external); and
    - Internal Audit should perform an independent review of the bank’s capital framework implementation every year in accordance with the Capital Standards.

Risks that can be identified from this section include:

- The risk that the ICAAP is not complete or suitable for the bank’s context, operational conditions, or the reliability of controls behind it.
- The risk that the bank’s risk management process is not coherent, valid, or rational.
- The risk that the data input to the ICAAP is not accurate or comprehensive.
- The risk that the ICAAP output and assumptions in use are not rational.
- The risk that the stress tests and analysis of assumptions are not rational or suitable.
- The risk that the ICAAP outcomes are not consolidated with the risk management (e.g., limit setting and monitoring).
- The risk that the capital plan and internal capital targets are not rational.
