The ICAAP is an ongoing process. On an annual basis, every bank is required to submit a document outlining the outcome of the ICAAP to the Central Bank.\n2. The ICAAP supplements the Pillar 1 minimum regulatory capital requirements by (i) identifying risks that are not addressed or not fully addressed through Pillar 1 regulations, referred to as Pillar 2 risks, and (ii) determining a level of capital commensurate with the level of risk.\n3. The Central Bank requires each bank to adopt a Pillar 1 plus approach. According to this, the bank\u2019s total capital requirements include the minimum Pillar 1 regulatory capital requirements, plus the capital required to cover Pillar 2 risks. As a result, the ICAAP should result in additional capital requirements specific to each bank\u2019s business model.\n4. Board and Senior Management are responsible to deliver a comprehensive, effective, and accurate assessment of capital adequacy. Each bank is consequently required to conduct an ICAAP supported by appropriate methods and procedures to ensure that adequate capital covers all material risks.\n5. The frequency of reporting to the Board is expected to be at least quarterly, but, depending on the size, complexity, business model, risk types of the institution, and the market environment, reporting might need to be more frequent to ensure timely management actions.\n6. The ICAAP should be supported by robust methodologies and data. All models used directly or indirectly in the ICAAP should follow the bank\u2019s model management framework, in compliance with the Central Bank Standards and Guidance. The data employed in the ICAAP should be comprehensive, reliable, follow rigorous quality checks, and control mechanisms."]}, {"Capital Planning": ["**Key Points**\n\n1. The ICAAP should be forward-looking taking into account both internal and external drivers over a period covering three (3) to five (5) years.\n2. The multi-year capital forecast should be assessed and calibrated through two perspectives: Pillar 1 and Pillar 2.\n3. For each internal stress test scenario for capital planning purposes, each bank is expected to consider credible, quantifiable management actions that the bank could practically take to mitigate any capital impact of stress scenarios.\n4. The following elements should be included in the ICAAP report or related appendix:\n    * Assumptions related to business developments over the forecasted period\n    * Assumptions related to the economic environment over the forecasted period\n    * Summary of historic capital base, aggregate RWAs, and CAR ratios for a minimum of five (5) years\n    * Disclosure of the following forecasted financial projections:\n        * Detailed balance sheet\n        * Detailed statement of profit and loss\n        * Break down of Capital base into its regulatory components\n        * Break down of Risk Weighted Assets (RWAs) components\n        * Significant ratios (e.g. CET 1, Tier 1, and CAR)\n        * A method to calibrate capital needs to the current and expected levels of risks, in coherence with the bank\u2019s risk appetite, business plan, and strategy\n        * It should include the likely future constraints on the availability and the use of capital\n        * Any future regulatory and accounting changes that can potentially impact such plan.\n5. Banks are required to fulfill internal risk appetite requirements in the bank\u2019s self-assessment of Pillar 1 and Pillar 2 minimum regulatory capital requirements.\n6.

If the risk transfer is considered insufficient or non-existent, the Central Bank will require the application of a higher capital requirement than prescribed under Pillar 1 or, alternatively, may deny a bank from obtaining any capital relief from the securitisations.\n3. Banks either underestimated or did not anticipate that a market-wide disruption could prevent them from securitising warehoused or pipeline exposures and did not anticipate the effect this could have on liquidity, earnings and capital adequacy.\n4. A bank must conduct analyses of the underlying risks when investing in the structured products and must not solely rely on the external credit ratings assigned to securitisation exposures by the credit rating agencies.\n5. The Central Bank will be vigilant in determining implicit support and will take appropriate supervisory action to mitigate the effects.\n6.
